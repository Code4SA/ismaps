  <h3>Data Sources</h3>

  <p>The informal settlement map combines information from different datasets that were obtained from the City of Cape Town in 2015 via access to information requests (PAIA). 
Constraints - Hard copies of the constraints data were obtained from the City of Cape Town via PAIA.<br>
<p><b>The Matrix</b> - This is a database developed by the Human Settlements Directorate and contains various contextual data including informal settlement and pocket names, area and structure counts, estimate of household size, and the upgrade category. Obtained via PAIA.</p>
<p><b>Toilet counts</b> - This is a database held by the Utilities Directorate and contains the GPS coordinates for flush toilets as well as a count of all toilets by location. Obtained via PAIA.</p>
<p><b>Porta Potty counts</b> - This information is not included in the City’s database for toilet infrastructure. Presumably because the location cannot be pinpointed accurately once distributed. We obtained the  numbers and locations from the original tender. Please note that it is likely that there are less porta potties available, due to damage and loss. Obtained via PAIA.</p>


<h3>Geocoding the Informal Settlement Pockets</h3>

<p>The City has GPS coordinates for flush toilets. We used these to locate the pockets that have full flush toilets and then drew boundaries around the pockets. In cases where no GPS coordinates could be found, it was necessary to refer to a hard copy map of the informal settlements that was received from the City - these boundaries were then geocoded using satellite imagery.</p>

<p>13 pockets could not be located:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead><tr><th style="width: 50%">Settlement</th><th style="width: 50%">Pocket</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>Mfuleni Infills</td><td>Bohlo Bohlo</td></tr>

<h3>Definitions of constraints</h3><a id="constraints"></a>
<p>These constrains were assigned and defined by the City of Cape Town.</p>
<table class="table">

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p><b>Temporary Toilets layer</b> - We determined this layer by adding all of the temporary toilets together and calculated the percentage of all the toilets installed in a pocket (this is basically all toilets except full flush toilets)</p>

<p><b>Density layer</b> - we determined the density by dividing the area in hectares by the number of households giving the dwelling per hectare (DHa).</p><br>

<p>This table shows the City's categorisation of housing density in the left two columns. The third column shows how these categories were grouped for the purpose of this matrix.</p>

<table class="table">
<thead><tr><th>A1</th><th>Occupation permitted</th><th>City land. Can be upgraded</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Approved projects (UISP, BNG, CRU, etc.)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td><td>For current and imminent full upgrades</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <thead><tr><th>A2</th><th>Occupation permitted</th><th>City land. Can be upgraded</th></tr></thead>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Future project in planning phase</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Commence with pre-planning</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Preparations of funding and applications</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <thead><tr><th>B1</th><th>Occupation temporary on City owned land</th><th>City land. Some constraints</th></tr></thead>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Adverse physical conditions (i.e. zoning, access to bulk services & transport, etc.)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td><td>De-densification required</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
 <tr><td> </td><td>Programming and budgeting (de-densification, re-blocking, etc.)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

 <tr><td> </td><td>Searching for suitable land / IDA / TRA</td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The values for Housing Density presented discrepancies and have been removed for the following pockets:</p>

<table class="table">
<thead><tr><th style="width: 50%">Settlement</th><th style="width: 50%">Pocket</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>Jim se Bos</td><td>Jim se Bos</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Browns Farm Infills</td><td>Browns Farm Xhwithinja</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Bosasa</td><td>Bosasa Phase 2</td></tr>
